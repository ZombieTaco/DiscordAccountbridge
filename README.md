# Discord Account Bridge
Send Messages and control another account through Discord

---

You can send messages with your main account, and have the message repeated from another account in another server 

When sending messages, your User"Bot" will delete your discord message and send the message to your desired channel, replacing it with the webhook variant.

---

`npm install discord.js`

---

Edit:

`INITIAL-CHANNEL` - Your initial channel id

`TARGET-CHANNEL` - Your target channel id

`TOKEN` - your bot token

`WEBHOOK-ID/SECRET` - Your initial channel webhookID and Secret

Make a Normal User account, (account ban is probable, but not likely.) and grab the token through your browser/client.
